# ✅ Time Display Fix Summary

## 🕐 **How Times Work Now:**

### **Upload/Share Times (Past):**
- Shows when content was originally created
- **"Just now"** - Under 1 minute ago
- **"5 minutes ago"** - Recent uploads
- **"2 hours ago"** - Older content
- **"12/15/2024, 9:11 AM"** - Very old content

### **Expiry Times (Future):**
- Shows when content will expire (60 minutes from last access)
- **"in 58 minutes"** - Will expire soon
- **"in 1 hour"** - Recently accessed, timer reset
- **"Expired"** - Content has expired

## 📱 **Example Display:**

```
📁 File Upload
   📅 Uploaded: 5 minutes ago
   ⏳ Expires: in 55 minutes

📝 Text Share  
   📅 Shared: Just now
   ⏳ Expires: in 59 minutes
```

## 🔄 **How Expiry Works:**

1. **Upload file** → Expires in 60 minutes
2. **Someone views it** → Timer resets to 60 minutes from now
3. **No activity** → Content expires and gets deleted
4. **View expired content** → Shows "Content not found"

## 🎯 **What's Fixed:**

- ✅ Upload times show in your local timezone
- ✅ Expiry times show future time countdown
- ✅ Different logic for past vs future times
- ✅ Live updates every minute
- ✅ Hover shows full date/time
